# Stone Paper Scissors Game

A classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game implemented in Python.

## Overview

This Python-based console game is a simple implementation of the traditional Stone-Paper-Scissors game where users play against the computer. Users select their choice (Stone, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer generates its choice randomly. The winner is determined based on the game rules: Stone crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Stone.

## Features

- Users can input their choice using integers (1 for Stone, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors).
- The computer generates its choice randomly.
- Prints the user's choice, the computer's choice, and the game outcome (Win, Lose, or Tie).
- Conducts multiple rounds (default: 5) and displays the final result (Win, Lose, or Tie for the player).
- Tracks the number of rounds won, lost, and tied.
